bucket_logs

A simple tool to grab the s3 bucket log data from s3 and make it
available to your python analysis tools or just print it as a table.

To use:

You'll need to install the boto library:

$ easy_install boto

And you'll need to set up a config.ini file that includes your aws
access key, secret key, and the bucket and log prefix you're
interested in. You can copy config.ini.sample and just fill in the
blanks.

Then you're ready to run:

$ python bucketlogs.py

At the top of the bucketlogs.py file is a list of fields that will be
printed if you just run this script directly. If you instead use this
script as a library you'll probably use the log_lines method to get an
array of all of the log. Each item in the array is a dictionary that
includes all of the log fields. See the comments on the log_lines
method for a complete description of all of the log fields available.
